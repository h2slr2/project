## run_analysis.R Structure:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
	of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	

## Repository structure:

-README.md
-codebook.md:  describing the variables produced by run_analysis.R
-run_analysis.R: the R script that produces the tidyData.txt file, 
 and this code can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.
-tidyData.txt: created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE.
	This is the file generated by run_analysis.R.
